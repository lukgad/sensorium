#summary What you will need to run Sensorium2

= Requirements =

== Windows ==

You will need:
 * Windows XP or later.
 * .NET framework 3.5

If you want to access local sensors, you will also need [http://www.almico.com/sfdownload.php SpeedFan], which must be running whenever you run Sensorium2. If you forget, the plugin will disable itself and you'll have to enable it in the [TextConfigFile config file].

== Linux ==

You will need:
 * mono 2.0

If you want to access local sensors you will also need [http://www.lm-sensors.org/ lm-sensors] v3.x and a kernel that supports it. If you don't need this, you will need to disable the libsensors plugin in the [TextConfigFile config file] (or add -c on the command line, then re-enable the plugins you want)
